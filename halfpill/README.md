<p>This is a website for Half Pill, an enemy for Super Pest Tower: Phil the Pencil 4, an upcoming game. In this website, I pretend to be a Half Pill. This is my first website so there may be issues.</p>
<p>If you don't know, <strong>Super Pest Tower</strong> is a game, and the fourth mainline installment of the Phil the Pencil series.</p>

<h2>About Super Pest Tower</h2>
<p>The game centers around Super Pest, who hates immature kids so that he can get money from an unknown Penciliean (Who is later revealed to be Rickley "Marshals" Tree), and it's up to you, Phil to stop Super Pest from causing perfect chaos on Pencilia.</p>
